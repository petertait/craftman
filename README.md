# Craft CMS Manager

Craft CMS is an excellent content management tool, but its configuration and setup can be a bit troublesome for those not familiar with PHP.
It's the main reason `craftman` arise, to help speed set up and start a new Craft CMS installation smoothly.

## Installation

First you'll need to make sure your system has git, docker and docker-compose.

Note: `craftman` does not support Windows.

### Install script

To install or update craftman, you can use cURL:

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petertait/craftman/master/craftman_install | sh

or Wget:

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petertait/craftman/master/craftman_install | sh

<sub>The script clones the craftman repository to `~/.craftman/bin` and adds the source line to your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc` or `~/.profile`).</sub>

You can customize the install source, directory and profile using the `CRAFTMAN_DIR`, and `PROFILE` variables.
Eg: `curl ... | CRAFTMAN_DIR="path/to/craftman" sh`

## Usage

If you want to develop locally a new site using Craft CMS:

    mkdir mysite && cd mysite

    craftman --port=8080 install

If you want to deploy on heroku:

    craftman heroku:prepare

    # commit your files, and then:

    heroku create
    heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite
    git push heroku master
    heroku open /admin

How to access craft container terminal?

    craftman run

You can also access mysql container running:

    craftman mysql:run

If you need make a mysql backup, run it:

    craftman mysql:backup

If you want restore a mysql backup, run it:

    craftman mysql:restore <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>

## Advanced

Sometimes we need a little more customization. For that, you can use craftman hooks:

If you want hook mysql restore to edit .sql file before import:

Edit your `[YOUR-PROJECT-DIRECTORY]/.craftman/config` and add this function:

<sub>**IMPORTANT**: THIS HOOK CODE IS JUST A SAMPLE USAGE</sub>

    function mysql_restore_hook()
    {
        cm_log "Processing '$1' file before import"
    	cm_log "+ Replace www.mysite.com to localhost"
    	cm_log "+ Remove https from localhost URLs"
    	cm_log "+ Doesn't import craft_searchindex (We prefer to rebuild index using craft)"
    	cat "$1" \
    		| sed -e 's/www\.mysite\.com/localhost/g' \
    		| sed -r 's/https?([:\/\\]+)localhost/http\1localhost/g' \
    		| perl -pe 'BEGIN{undef $/;} s/INSERT INTO .?craft_searchindex.*?DROP TABLE/DROP TABLE/sg' \
    			> "$1.tmp"
    	cm_log "+ Showing 20 lines of diff after file processed"
    	diff "$1" "$1.tmp" | head -n 20
    	cm_log "+ Removing temporary files"
    	mv "$1" "$1.bak"
    	mv "$1.tmp" "$1"
    	rm -f "$1.bak"
    }

There are other hooks:

function cm_config_hook()

        Use this hook to override craftman configurations

function mysql_backup_hook( *[sql-file-path]* )

        Use this hook to preprocess .sql before gzip file

function mysql_restore_hook( *[sql-file-path]* )

        Use this hook to preprocess .sql before import to MySQL

## Plugins

Create your plugin and put at `~/.craftman/plugins/[your-plugin]/[your-plugin].plugin`

All public functions must start with `pluginname__`

        hello__usage() { ... }

All private functions name must start with `__pluginname_`

        __hello_some_util() { ... }

All variables must start with `PLUGINNAME__`

        HELLO__VAR="Hello World"

All hooks must start with "pluginname_" and ends with "_hook"

        hello_world_hook() { ... }

Notes:

- You can use `CM_` variables and `cm_` functions.
- Never use private craftman functions prefixed with `_cm`.
- Prefixes `cm_`, `_cm`, `CM_`, `CRAFTMAN_` for variables and functions are all reserved to `craftman`- Never do any work outside of functions.

## Problems

If you try to install craft and the installation fails, you might get an error when trying to reinstall them again or you might get an error like the following:

    file not found

You can try force `-F` to redownload craft, `-O` to regenerate configurations and `-R` to recreate containers, using:

    craftman -F -O -R install
